- # 🌿 FUTURE_UIUX_02 – Wellness Habit Tracker App (UI/UX Design Task)

This repository contains my Task 2 submission for the **FUTUREINTERNS UI/UX Internship Program**.  
The task was to design a **mobile-first wellness application** focused on building healthy habits, tracking progress, and supporting users through a calm and minimal UI.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a **Wellness Habit Tracker App** inspired by Calm, Headspace, and Strava.  
The app helps users track daily habits, stay consistent, and maintain mental & physical wellness.

I designed the core user flow and created clean, accessible, and calming UI screens using **Poppins** for headings and **Inter** for body text, with a soft color palette.
